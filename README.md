Was very unsatisfied with all Japanese readers available because they were either bloated or lacking basic features, so I made this one focused on a single use case which is reading Japanese books/manga.

Has an OCR tool that allows selecting text segments from the image and a button to open it in jisho. (No machine translation, that shit is a crime against humanity!)

Has a feature that inverts the colors of text only pages without affecting illustration pages (effectively a dark mode).

Optimized hotkeys for moving and resizing the image in a intuitive way.

Very effective tool for learning Japanese.

Session saving and loading. Save your current session to a save slot with a single click and load it with a single click to get everything exactly how you left it, supports multiple sessions.

Python 12.8


Hotkeys:

-Change pages : left arrow, right arrow, a, d

-Zoom in/out: -, +, q, e

-Move page: mouse drag, scroll, down, up, s, w

-Toggle fullscreen: Alt+Enter
